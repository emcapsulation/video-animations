Scene 1
Here's a problem for you. This is the leaderboard of a sports league. 

Column w shows the number of wins each team has received, and l, the number of losses. Column r shows the number of remaning games each team has. And the four columns after this shows who the the teams' remaining games are to be played against.

The winner of the season is whichever team wins the most games.

The question for you is: Which teams have no chance of winning the season?

To start, let's consider the team currently in last place. They have two wins, and two games remaining. Do they have a chance of taking home the trophy?

No, because even if they win both their remaining games, they still end up with only four wins, which is not enough to ever take the lead.

As a result, this team is "trivially eliminated".
