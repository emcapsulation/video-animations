Scene 1
Here's a problem for you. This is the leaderboard of a sports league. 

Column w shows the number of wins each team has received, and l, the number of losses. Column r shows the number of remaning games each team has. And the four columns after this shows who the the teams' remaining games are to be played against.

The winner of the season is whichever team wins the most games.

The question for you is: Which teams have no chance of winning the season?

To start, let's consider the team currently in last place. They have two wins, and two games remaining. Do they have a chance of taking home the trophy?

No, because even if they win both their remaining games, they still end up with only four wins, which is not enough to ever take the lead.

As a result, this team is "trivially eliminated".

But what about the third team?

You might think they have a chance of winning, since they have two games remaining.

If they win both of these games, as long as the team currently in first place loses all of their remaining games, they can both finish off the season with 6 wins and tie for the trophy right?

Well, not quite.

We need to consider who Circle's remaining games are against.

Circle has three games left to play against Triangle. Remember, Circle needs to lose all three of these remaining games to not overtake Pentagon, if Pentagon wants to tie for the trophy. 

This means Triangle must win those three games. But, this would actually put Triangle into first place instead.

As a result, Pentagon cannot win the season. They are eliminated too, but not trivially.


Scene 2
And to see how complicated this can get, here is a much larger example. Can you show that <shape> has no chance of winning the season?

What if I told you this could be turned into a max flow problem?


Scene 3
This is known as the baseball elimination algorithm. But before I show you the algorithm, what is a max flow problem?
